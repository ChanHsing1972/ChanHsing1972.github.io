不多废话，快来玩玩[简陋版七圣召唤](https://github.com/ChanHsing1972/Genius-Invokation-TCG)！

技术很菜，游戏 UI 十分简朴😝，只用命令提示符实现了最最基本的功能……本质上就是一个~~赌博~~掷骰子的小游戏，胜负由随机数说了算🤣。

Come and try [my first C project](https://github.com/ChanHsing1972/Genius-Invokation-TCG)! 

The project is completely powered by Command Prompt, which means the UI is rather simple. Improvement is still required in many aspects. But never mind. Just give it a shot!

Because of the lack of time, graphics library is not available in the project. I'm planning to learn SDL2 to make the game more vivid & enjoyable. Graphics library would be applied to my future projects. Stay tuned.
