Abraham Lincoln, one of America’s most respected presidents once stated, “Give me six hours to chop down a tree, and I will spend the first hour sharpening the axe.” What lies behind the famous remark is the secret which leads individuals to success. It indicates the significance of comprehensive preparation and planning before undertaking any task.

Take chopping down a tree as an instance. Most people may save every hour and second chopping the trunk, as they argue that immediate action seems to be more effective. However, they entirely ignore the reduction in efficiency which results from the poor quality of their tools. Apparently, spending an hour sharpening the tool in advance will bring a huge leap in efficiency, which is actually a wiser and more rational way to tackle with the task.

And in our life, sharpening the axe before chopping the tree symbolizes the importance of adequate preparation before we take out our first step. By investing time in preparing and improving our skills, tools, or strategies, the waste of efforts and resources is minimized. We are able to enhance our ability to accomplish tasks more swiftly and with greater precision. As a result, we are more likely to succeed.

In contrast, neglecting preparation often leads to inefficiency and wasted effort. Without taking time to plan and equip us with necessary tools and knowledge, we may find ourselves struggling to accomplish tasks effectively, making it much harder for us to achieve success.

In China, there’s actually a saying which is similar to Lincoln’s remark: “A workman must sharpen his tools if he is to do his work well.” Both of them emphasize the importance of adequate planning and reveal the secret which leads individuals to success. No matter how skilled someone is, it’s always preparation that sets the stage for his/her optimal performance in the later days. Thus, as teenagers who shoulders the responsibility of the era, we should learn from Lincoln's wisdom, recognize the power of preparation, and maximize our potential for success.
